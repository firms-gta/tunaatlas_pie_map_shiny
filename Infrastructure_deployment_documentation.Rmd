# Deploying Docker Images on Blue-Cloud Infrastructure
## Introduction

This document explains how to create a ticket for deploying Docker images created for Shiny applications on the Blue-Cloud infrastructure. The process involves specifying the necessary details in the ticket so the infrastructure team can handle the deployment efficiently.

### Preliminary Steps

Before creating the ticket, ensure the following steps are completed:

1. **Pull the Docker Image**:
  Verify that the Docker image can be pulled successfully from the container registry:
   
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/username/my_shiny_app:latest
```

2. **Test the Image Locally**:
Run the Docker image locally to confirm it works as expected:
   
```bash
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 ghcr.io/username/my_shiny_app:latest
```

   Access the app at `http://localhost:3838` and validate its functionality.

### Information to include in the ticket

When creating a ticket to deploy a Shiny application as a Docker image, ensure the following details are included:

#### 1. **Docker image details**
- **Image Name**: Provide the full name and tag of the Docker image (e.g., `ghcr.io/username/my_shiny_app:latest`).
- **Container Registry URL**: Include the URL where the image is hosted (e.g., GitHub Container Registry).

#### 2. **Application information**
- **App Name**: A descriptive name for the Shiny application.
- **Display Name**: The name as it should appear in the VRE.
- **Description**: A brief summary of the app's purpose and functionality.

#### 3. **Run command**
Provide the exact Docker run command or equivalent details, such as:

```bash
CMD ["R", "-e", "shiny::runApp('/root/my_shiny_app', host='0.0.0.0', port=3838')"]
```

#### 5. **Resource requirements**
Mention any specific resource requirements for the application, such as:
- Memory limits
- CPU requirements.

#### 6. **Testing and validation**
Indicate if the image has been tested locally and confirm that it is functional:
