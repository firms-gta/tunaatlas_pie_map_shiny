# Introduction
This guide explains how to create a docker image of a shiny application using Docker Buildx with a remote cache stored on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) in local. It will help you replicate and debug workflows locally, including proper authentication for private caches.

# For now, build the shiny app in local 

```bash
docker build -t tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny .
```

######## NOT WORKING YET IN LOCAL ONLY WITH GITHUB ACTIONS

# Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following tools are installed and configured on your system:

- **Docker**: Install the latest version from [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/).
- **Docker Buildx**: Ensure Buildx is enabled in Docker:

```bash
docker buildx create --use
```
- **GitHub Account**: With permissions to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT).

# Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Navigate to your GitHub account's **Personal Access Tokens** page: [Generate PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Set the following scopes:
   - `write:packages` (to push to the cache).
   - `read:packages` (to pull from the cache).
4. Save the generated token securely (you will need it later).

# Step 2: Login to GHCR Locally

Authenticate Docker with your PAT:

```bash
echo <YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> | docker login ghcr.io -u <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin
```

Replace `<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>` and `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub token and username, respectively.

# Step 3: Create a `event.json` File

Create a `event.json` file to store the necessary inputs for your local builds:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "base_branch": "main",
    "action": "build-no-cache"
  }
}

```


Create a secrets.env file with the connection to ghcr

```env
GITHUB_ACTOR=
GHCR_TOKEN=
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

# Step 4: Verify Docker Buildx Installation

Ensure Docker Buildx is set up and working:

```bash
docker buildx version
```

If not, enable Buildx:

```bash
docker buildx create --use
```

# Step 6: Build with Remote Cache (Incoming)

Use the following `docker buildx build` command to build your image with caching:

```bash
docker buildx build --cache-from=type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/firms-gta/tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny-cache:latest \
                    --cache-to=type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/firms-gta/tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny-cache:latest,mode=max \
                    --progress=plain -t tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny .
```

- Replace `firms-gta` with your GitHub repository.
- Replace `tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny` with your desired cache name.

### Explanation
- `--cache-from`: Pulls cached layers from the remote registry.
- `--cache-to`: Updates the cache in the registry with newly built layers.
- `-t`: Tags the built image.

# Step 7: Verify Cache Usage

Check if the cache was used during the build:

```bash
docker buildx du
```

This command will display the cache usage.

# Step 8: Run Locally with `act`

To simulate your GitHub Actions workflow locally, use `act` with the `-s` flag for secrets:

1. Install `act`:
   ```bash
   brew install act  # macOS
   sudo apt install act  # Ubuntu
   ```

2. Run the workflow:
   ```bash
   act workflow_dispatch -s GITHUB_USERNAME=<your_github_username> -s GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token>
   ```

Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

# Additional Notes

- If you encounter a `401 Unauthorized` error, verify that:
  - Your PAT has the correct permissions (`write:packages`, `read:packages`).
  - Docker is logged in to GHCR (`docker login ghcr.io`).

- Use public caches for simplified access if authentication is not desired.

By following these steps, you can efficiently build and test Docker images locally while leveraging remote caching for faster builds.
