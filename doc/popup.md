This is a generic Shiny app which can display any fisheries data complying with the [CWP](https://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/en/) standard. This Shiny app has been developped to explore the Global Tuna Atlas datasets. It is hosted in the same [Virtual Lab](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/group/globalfisheriesatlas) provided by [Blue-Cloud 2026](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org) project which implements best practices for Open Science and FAIR data management:
* **data**: the default datasets used by this app have been published and assigned DOIs on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?q=metadata.creators.person_or_org.name%3A%22FIRMS%20Global%20Tuna%20Atlas%20Technical%20Working%20Group%22&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=bestmatch).
* **code**: code is open and freely available on a ["shiny_compare_tunaatlas_datasets" GitHub repository](https://github.com/firms-gta/shiny_compare_tunaatlas_datasests) and main releases have been assigned ["DOIs on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/XXX). The code can be directly executed within the RStudio server hosted by the Virtual Lab. 
* **virtual environment**: the R code combines the use of both renv package and Docker container to snapshot the environment required to execute the app. 
* **team**: this work is provided by [IRD](https://www.ird.fr/) with the support of CNR for IT aspects and FIRMS partners (FAO and tuna RFMOs).
You can freely [register as a new member](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/group/globalfisheriesatlas) of the virtual Lab if you want to learn more.
